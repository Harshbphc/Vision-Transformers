# Vision-Transformers

My project on Vision Transformer research paper. I have run the various experiments given in the research paper. Although I could not completely mimic those experiments because of hardware constraints such as RAM.

I have run various experiments given in the research paper and evaluated performance for each model separately by graphing model train accuracy, validation accuracy and then evaluated on the test set.
